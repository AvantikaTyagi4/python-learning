# tuple are similar to lists but we can not modify them, we can not insert in tuple or remove any item from tupple
# Tuple are immutable

# to define tupple we use parentisis instead of big bracket

number = (1, 3,6)
# to print first element of tupple
print(number[0])

# if we try to change the item / add , delete item we get following err
# TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment
# number[0]= 30
